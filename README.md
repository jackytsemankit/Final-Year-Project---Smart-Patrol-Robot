# fyp-smart-patrol-robot
Development of an automatic body-temperature measurement system for the Patrol Robots from the Hong Kong Airport Authorities
▪	Bought and installed thermal camera on functioning patrol robots
▪	Instructed the robot to patrol along a self-defined route automatically and repeatedly
▪	Measures the body temperature of nearby persons along the patrol
▪	When a fevering person is spotted, automatically takes pictures of the person
▪	Relevant information such as the time and location of the fever case, along with the images captured will be uploaded to a database
▪	Built a web-portal for users to easily view and manage the fever cases
▪	Makes use of facial recognition technology to avoid one single person raising multiple fever cases
